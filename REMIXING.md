## Remixing

Allowing remixing means that others can download, edit, change, and re-publish your Hubs avatar as long as they give credit to the creators of the avatar. If you allow remixing, you agree to license your avatar under a [CC-BY 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode) license. Weâ€™ll provide you an opportunity to include the attribution information you want to include. This information will be associated with the avatar, but not stored with your account.

You can change this setting at any time, by re-saving your avatar.

If you don't allow remixing, your content will be published under the Hubs [Terms of Service](https://github.com/mozilla/hubs/blob/master/TERMS.md).
