# Hubs and Spoke Privacy Notice

Aug 24, 2021

In this Privacy Notice, we explain what data [Hubs](https://hubs.mozilla.com) and [Spoke](https://hubs.mozilla.com/spoke) collect and share, and why. We also adhere to the practices outlined in the Mozilla [Privacy Policy](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/) for how we receive, handle, and share information.

## Information We Collect and Share When You’re In a Room

### Information You Share With Us and Other Participants

We need certain information to operate Hubs and Spoke. For example, we need information about your account in order to save your avatar. Here’s the information we may receive from you:

**Account information**: You don’t need an account to use Hubs. However, certain features (like storing your avatar), require an account. You can create an account through Mozilla or through Discord. If you create an account with your email address, we store a hashed version of your email address. If you create an account through Discord, we receive the email address associated with your Discord account and your Discord avatar.

**Room Name and URL**: Rooms and room names are publicly accessible to anyone with the URL. Mozilla stores the name and the URL for the link you share so you and others with the link to the Room can use it again.

**Avatar data**: Your selected avatar and name will be shared with other participants in your room. If you’re logged in to your account, we will store your avatar. If you’re not logged into your account, we will not store your avatar.

**Voice data**: If your microphone is on, Hubs sends the audio to other users in the room. Mozilla does not store the audio; we only receive it temporarily to transmit it to others in the room.

**Chat**: If you send messages in Hubs, Hubs shares it with the other users in the room. Mozilla does not store chats; we only receive it temporarily to transmit it to others in the room.

**Photos and Videos You Take, and Photos, Videos, and Objects You Upload**: If you take photos and video in a Hubs room or upload photos, videos, or objects to a room, Mozilla stores them so you can share them within the room. They are deleted within 72 hours unless you pin them. If you pin them they will be stored until you remove them from the room and they will be viewable by anyone who can access the room.

You can learn more by looking at the code itself: [Hubs](https://github.com/mozilla/hubs) (the front-end) [Dialog](https://github.com/mozilla/dialog/) (the webRTC server), [Reticulum](https://github.com/mozilla/reticulum) (the backend web server), [Hubs-Ops](https://github.com/mozilla/hubs-ops) (the infrastructure code), [Discord Bot](https://github.com/MozillaReality/hubs-discord-bot) (enables users to connect their Discord community to Hubs).

### Other Information We Receive

We use technical, interaction, error, and website analytics data to help us improve the Hubs and Spoke experiences:

**Technical data**: We receive data about the type of device you use to interact with Hubs, as well as its operating system, language, the name and version of browser, and other data needed to load and operate a room.

**Interaction data**: We receive data about your interactions with Hubs, such as the number of rooms created, messages sent through or to third-party services like Discord (including aggregated counts such as the number of messages and users who have joined relevant channels), the number of users in a particular room, the start and end time of a your interaction with Hubs, the amount of time you interact with Hubs through virtual reality, the first time in a particular month or day that you begins to use Hubs.

  
  

**Error Data**: When Hubs or Spoke crashes or fails, Mozilla receives error messages which may include the room URL, response time for requests, the page you were on when you encountered the error, your operating system, browser information, and your IP address.

**Website Analytics Data**: We use Google Analytics (GA) to better understand how you interact with Hubs and Spoke For example, we collect de-identified information about the number of Hubs rooms you create or enter, your interactions with buttons and menus, your session length, your location (country, state/province, and city), language settings, your browser type and version, viewport size, and screen resolution. You can opt-out of GA data collection by installing the [Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

## Information We Collect When Your Create and Publish Scenes or Custom Avatars

**Scenes and avatars you create**: You need an account to create scenes in Spoke and custom avatars in Hubs. When you create a scene or custom avatar, Mozilla stores that scene or avatar so we can display it.

**Attribution information**: When you publish a scene or avatar to Hubs, you have the option to “Allow Remixing with Creative Commons [CC-BY 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/)” or allow Mozilla to promote your scene or avatar. If you choose one or both of these options, Mozilla will share your scene or avatar and your attribution information publicly.

**Account information**: To publish a scene or avatar to Hubs, you need to have a Hubs account. Mozilla will receive and store a hashed version of your email address to allow you to log in and view your 3D Room models and Avatars.
