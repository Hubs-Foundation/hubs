# Icons

We use [svgr](https://react-svgr.com/) for our icons.

Icons are kept in a Figma design document. To add an icon, export it from Figma with all colors set to black. The black colors can then be replaced in CSS stylesheets by simply setting `color` as you would for text.

SVGR configuration properties are set in the webpack config. There is an identical config in the Storybook webpack config.
