[Learn more about Hubs](https://hubs.mozilla.com/docs/welcome.html)

## Getting Started

If you would like to run Hubs on your own servers, check out [Hubs Cloud](https://hubs.mozilla.com/docs/hubs-cloud-intro.html).

If you would like to deploy a custom client to your existing Hubs Cloud instance please refer to [this guide](https://hubs.mozilla.com/docs/hubs-cloud-custom-clients.html).

If you would like to contribute to the main fork of the Hubs client please see the [contributor guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

If you just want to check out how Hubs works and make your own modifications continue on to our Quick Start Guide.

### Quick Start

[Install NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) if you haven't already. We recommend version 12 or above.

Run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mozilla/hubs.git
cd hubs
npm ci
npm run dev
```

The backend dev server is configured with CORS to only accept connections from "hubs.local:8080", so you will need to access it from that host. To do this, you likely want to add "hubs.local" and "hubs-proxy.local" to the [local "hosts" file](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-edit-hosts-file-in-windows-mac-or-linux) on your computer:

```
127.0.0.1	hubs.local
127.0.0.1	hubs-proxy.local
```

Then visit https://hubs.local:8080 (note: HTTPS is required, you'll need to accept the warning for the self-signed SSL certificate)

> Note: When running the Hubs client locally, you will still connect to the development versions of our [Janus WebRTC](https://github.com/mozilla/janus-plugin-sfu) and [reticulum](https://github.com/mozilla/reticulum) servers. These servers do not allow being accessed outside of localhost. If you want to host your own Hubs servers, please check out [Hubs Cloud](https://hubs.mozilla.com/docs/hubs-cloud-intro.html).
